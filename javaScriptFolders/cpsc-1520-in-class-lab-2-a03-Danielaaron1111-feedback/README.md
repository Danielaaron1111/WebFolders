## Running Tests

Before running your tests, run `pnpm install` in the terminal. This is a one-time command needed for a fresh clone of your repository.

To run the tests in the terminal, enter `pnpm run test`. To open the tests in the browser, run **`pnpm run test:ui`**.

> Note that you are not given any credit/marks for the tests grouped under `PROVIDED CODE`, as those tests ensure the correct functionality of code that is already provided for you. However, if you do anything to "break" the code already provided for you by causing the `PROVIDED CODE` tests to fail, then those failed tests will be deducted as a penalty to your marks.

----

## Marking Rubric

The [marking rubric](./RUBRIC.md) is aligned with the unit tests. Failed tests under `PROVIDED DOM module` are applied as a penalty. You will also be penalized if you make changes to the unit tests themselves.
