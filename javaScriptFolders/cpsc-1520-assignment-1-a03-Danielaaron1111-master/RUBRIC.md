# Marking Rubric

The marking rubric is aligned with the unit tests. Failed tests under `PROVIDED DOM module` are applied as a penalty, *not* as awarded marks. You will also be penalized if you make changes to the unit tests themselves.

> *You must begin work on your solution **as soon as possible** and **commit often** to this assignment repository.*

## Continuous Submission

This assignment permits *continuous submissions*, meaning that every commit up to the cutoff date is accepted as an update on your final solution. Also refer to the [**Git Commit**](#git-commit---assignmentlab-policy) requirements.

Your final submission must be before the deadline. Submissions after the deadline are ignored. Non-submissions will receive a zero unless extenuating circumstances meet program requirements.

## Individual Assessment

This assignment is delivered as an **individual assessment** of what you have learned up to this point in the course. This is ***NOT* a group project**.

## Git Commit - Assignment/Lab Policy

**NOTE:** You **must** demonstrate incremental development of your solution. This means that you must begin work on your solution as soon as possible and commit often to the assignment repository. Each commit must demonstrate functional improvements to the solution. **Failure to show incremental work during the assignment period will result in loss of marks of up to 20%.**
 
Additionally, you are encouraged to use external resources to help you learn what is needed for the assignment. However, if you submit code that differs greatly from what was demonstrated in class it must be documented (e.g. comments, citations, etc.) and you may be asked to provide a verbal explanation of how the code works to your instructor. Failure to explain any code you submitted will be considered as potential evidence of academic misconduct and may trigger an investigation, potentially resulting in further consequences.
