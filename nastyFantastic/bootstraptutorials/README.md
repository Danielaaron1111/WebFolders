## Lab 05: Bootstrap Grid System

This In-Class Lab is worth 5% of your overall grade.

You must be present in class in order to receive credit. 

---

## Instructions

For this Lab, you will use Bootstrap to create a gallery page for a fictitious website.

You have been given screenshots of the completed solution at each breakpoint, as well as all the html structure. You are only allowed to add Bootstrap classes. Nothing else is allowed.

Working on your own, you will use the Bootstrap grid and utilities to create a website that resembles the provided screenshots as much as possible. 

---

## Methodology

1. Clone a copy of this repository to your device so that you can develop it locally. When you finish, make sure to push your latest commit to GitHub Classroom. 

2. Begin by going to the [Official Bootstrap Website](https://getbootstrap.com/) and copying the provided CDN links for both the CSS and JavaScript libraries. 

3. Next, examine the screenshots for the layout changes at each breakpoint. No additional html can be added.

4. Add the Bootstrap grid and utility classes to create the necessary layouts. 

5. When finished, make sure to validate your HTML.

## Rubric

This lab will be out of five (5) marks. You will be graded on the following criteria:

- Bootstrap Grid. The Bootstrap Grid system is used to create a mobile-first flex layout; specifically, this entails using a container, rows, and various column classes, in the correct nesting order. Different sections of the website adapt to the size of the viewport and change their layout based upon Bootstrap's predefined breakpoints. All spacing is consistent.

- Out-of-the-box Bootstrap. Only Bootstrap classes are used to style and lay out the content. No additional CSS or inline styles are used.

In addition to these tasks, your solution must look as reasonably close to the provided screenshots as possible. Your solution must also follow all current best practices for the web. This means that your solution must also incorporate concepts previously introduced in this course, such as media queries, maximum-width containers, and relative units of measurement.

**Note**: Your HTML must be valid - that is, your code must pass W3C Validation - in order to receive credit for this Lab.
